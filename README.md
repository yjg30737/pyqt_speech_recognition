# pyqt_speech_recognition
PyQt speech recognition demonstrating example (using pydub and speech_recognition, very easy to use)

If you want to run this one

1. git clone
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. python main.py

You can find out how this works in script.py as always :)

Basically we have to convert mp3 file into wav file to use speech recognition

This GUI has basic thread to run the script and label(animated loading... label) to demonstrate mp3-to-text work is processing.
